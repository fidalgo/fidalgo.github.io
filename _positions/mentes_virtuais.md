description: |
   As an intern, I accomplished two significant feats that helped the company immensely. Firstly, I created a project that was embraced by several local radio stations and used commercially. Secondly, I took the lead on a project that was later passed on to a different team, ensuring that it adhered to the highest standards and best practices.

projects:
- As a solo developer, I spearheaded the development of a web application for managing and administering a new-generation communication service, providing fixed-mobile convergence in an IMS context.
- Performed analysis and requirements gathering for an ENUM server, which resulted in the development of a proof-of-concept using a database-backed nameserver adapted for ENUM context.
- As an intern, developed a value-added SMS and Wap Push service by integrating the SMS-Centre through a web application, allowing for easy campaign creation and management.
