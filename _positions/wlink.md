projects:
    - As a lead developer and project manager, I played a pivotal role in driving the success of several web and multimedia content projects. I began by ascertaining the status and customer perception of each project, defining a roadmap for their development and ensuring effective resource allocation. I also led the recruitment process and contracted external resources to ensure that we had the necessary expertise to deliver high-quality solutions.

    - One of my key achievements during this time was the specification and development of a communication module using an RS232 serial port with a custom-made GSM modem switch. This module facilitated seamless communication between our clients and their target audiences, allowing them to deliver timely and relevant content that resonated with their customers.
