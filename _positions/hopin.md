projects:
- I'm proud to have contributed significantly to the company's growth as the 6th employee, driving various initiatives ranging from API development, billing, scaling, and stress testing. My experience and expertise in the field have enabled me to conduct numerous technical and non-technical interviews, resulting in hundreds of successful hires.

- I had the opportunity to work on a crucial project that involved developing and optimizing the API that powered real-time online events. I had to work closely with the project team to understand the requirements and design an efficient and reliable API. The API needed to be scalable and handle numerous requests simultaneously, ensuring a seamless and uninterrupted user experience during events.

- As the leader of authentication and authorization projects, my focus was to implement industry-standard protocols such as OAuth2 and OpenID Connect to ensure that our user's data is secure, yet easily accessible across different applications. By spearheading this project, I was able to facilitate the seamless sharing of accounts and data between our applications, leading to a significant improvement in the user experience and overall performance of our products. Our implementation not only enhanced the efficiency and security of our systems, but also provided a convenient and efficient way for users to access their data across various applications.
