    Transforming investment research with innovative software solutions - leveraging cutting-edge technology and best practices to extract, enrich and deliver high-quality insights

projects:
- |
  As a senior software engineer at Visible Alpha, we spearheaded the development of a cutting-edge research processing and indexing system. Leveraging the latest technology, this system extracts, enriches and stores vital information from research reports, making it readily available for analysis and user consumption.
- |
  In addition, I played a key role in the splitting of our platform by extracting the research and event processing functionality, creating clear lines of responsibility and developing robust APIs for seamless data access.
- |
  Through my technical leadership, I also implemented essential development empowering techniques such as clean code, test-driven development (TDD), infrastructure as code and continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). This allowed us to deliver high-quality solutions that exceeded client expectations while keeping up with industry best practices.
